                            <p>I went to elementary school in years 2008-2017. The name of the school is Private Elementary School
                                Štvorlístok. It was very nice school and there was few of us in the class. At the end of final year,
                                there was only 11 of us in class. I made there many friends who I am friends with even now. The school
                                gave me very good basics for math and languages.

                                school helped me develop my math and language skills even further. I spent there one of the best
                                years of my life. I made there some of my lifelong friends and met a lot of people.

                                Currently I am studying in Brno at school University of Technology. My faculty is faculty of
                                Information Technology. I chose this school, because I wanted to learn something, that is going
                                to be needed in the future. I never programmed before, and it was quite a challenge, but I am here,
                                so I am doing something well.

                                    This project was about making program that simulates making of H2O molecule.
                                    Program uses semaphores and multi threading. It was supposed to show how to
                                    handle multiple signals without inducing deadlock. Program is written in C.

                                    This project was aimed at making calculator in group. We were supposed to
                                    simulate real life development as much as possible. This included documentation,
                                    deadlines, meetings versioning etc. We made calculator in Python.

                                    Specifically, program was supposed to filter info about COVID patients.
